# Job Search System

We implement a structured approach that secures data from multiple job hosting platforms and structures the data with coherency for efficient search queries. The searching algorithms apply constraints on the metadata based on the hyperparameters invoked by the user, such as location, type of job, and title of the job.


**BackEnd**

Pre-Requistes:

  1. Install Java JDK8 on the system.
  2. Set JAVA_HOME environment variable.
  3. PATH variable has JDK path.

Setup Instructions for local machine.

  1. If project is cloned/imported on Eclipse IDE:
      You can choose to simply right click on JobsApplication.java, click Run As > Java Application.
  2. The application will start-up on http://localhost:8080.
  3. Alternatively,
    You can open Terminal/Command Prompt at the project root folder, run 'mvn clean install'.
    This will create a jar file upon successful build.
    Run 'java -jar target\swe-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar'.
    This should boot up the application.
    To test you can go to http://localhost:8080 on the web browser.
